Check if the password you are using is exposed in data breaches.

Inspired by [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com)
I have used password API call to get the breached data(passwords) in this script.

(Use python 3.5 or above)
#### Usage:
    python check_pwnage.py <your_password>


If you are using this script in your program, you can call the function 'check_password' by passing it user password.
